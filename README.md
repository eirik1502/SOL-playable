# SOL-playable

The game "Smash of Legends" playables. That is, runnable jar's (runnable, packed, compressed java).

## Getting Started

### Installing

Every release comes with three programs (jars).
 - *Server* (The program running on one of the players computer)
 - *Client* (The program running on every players computer)
 - *Offline* (Not the actual game, just a version running without a server to see the game)

Download all of them by downloading *the-game* folder as a zip.
You can also download the individual programs if you go into the folder.

(If you want an older version of the game, you can explore the other archives)

Unpack the downloaded zip, and put the three files in a convenient location (f.ex. in your user folder).


### Running the game

One player has to run the *server* program.
All players (including the one running the server) has to run the client program.
In the clients, specify the IP-address of the server. *To find the ip-address*:
  1. the player running the server should head to CMD (or anoher command window)
  2. type "ipconfig"
  3. read the address of "IPv4 Address". It has a format similar to "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
  4. let every player write this address, and push "enter"
  (5. The player running the server don't need to type the address, just press enter ("localhost" is then recognized).)

### Playing the game

First, queue up for 1v1 or 2v2, and wait for the other players connected to your server.

#### Choose your character
The characters have different streangths and weeknesses. They have three unique attacks at their disposal. They are:
- *Frank*: The marksman. Specializes in long-range combat.
- *King Skurk Two*: The hook. He is a short range, powerful dude, using his hook to catch foes at a distance.
- *Brail*: The weird wizard. He is a medium ranged, wizard with chaotic attacks.
- *MagneT*: The sniper. A Masai that snipes people with his spear. He also utilizes his inner animal roar.

#### play the game

Controls:
- You control your characters movement with the keys: w, a, s, d.
- Aim with the mouse pointer.
- Perform different attacks with *left mouse button*, *right mouse button* and *space*

Mechanics:
- Attacks damage enemies and knocks them backwards.
- How far backward they are knocked, depends on their current damage count, displayed on the screen.
- If a character falls of the stage, they die.

The goal of the game:
- 1v1 mode: Kill the enemy 3 times (push the enemy off the field 3 times).
- 2v2 mode: both characters on a team must be in the enemy base at the same time. If you die, you respawn at your base.
