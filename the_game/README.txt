The newest SOL distriburion!

It is from the end of our project at Blank (03.06.17).

How to run:
1. Have java (jre) installed on your pc.
2. Run the server (no system arguments are required)
3. Run at least two clients (no system arguments are required)
4. The clients must connect to the server by specifying the ip address of the server.
	- "localhost" or [nothing] may be specified for localhost.
	- You can find your ip-address by executing "ipconfig" in a regular terminal. Use the "IPv4 Address".
	  The game is usually works on local networks. Remote networks, not so much.
